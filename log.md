##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

###Day 0: May 9, 2021 
**Today's Progress**: Studied and experimented how Kivy works plans to work on a GUI project with python.

 
**Thoughts**: Still stucked on the configuration part but I grasp the basics somehow.

###Day 1: May 23, 2021 
**Today's Progress**: I'm able to perform basic syntax of the Kivy lang. Did some experiments on how it works.

Also made a recall for basics of javascript I'm currently on objects and array manipulation plans to advance tommorow.


 
**Thoughts**: I'm getting a hard time mixing both school works and programming.
Also I'm too used in the python Lang that I always mix it up with js code often forget semicolon when writing code!!!
