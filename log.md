# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 9, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Studied and experimented how Kivy works plans to work on a GUI project with python.

 
**Thoughts**: Still stucked on the configuration part but I grasp the basics somehow.

### Day 1: May 23, 2021
**Today's Progress**: I'm able to perform basic syntax of the Kivy lang. Did some experiments on how it works.

Also made a recall for basics of javascript I'm currently on objects and array manipulation plans to advance tommorow.


 
**Thoughts**: I'm getting a hard time mixing both school works and programming.
Also I'm too used in the python Lang that I always mix it up with js code often forget semicolon when writing code!!!

### Day 2: May 27, 2021
**Today's Progress**: I did some **scraping, scripting and gui** programs today! I learned how to use **csv, and bs4** today by dong practical application of programming through scraping. **scripting** I'm able to make a bat script to sync my time through a desktop shortcut so I don't have to bother opening settings every time I open windows because time doesn't sync automatically.**gui** I played arround with kivy and able to learn more about layouts and kv lang.


 
**Thoughts**: I still need more practice using BS4 to get a good grasp in scraping. in Kv I need to utilize more of the language features that I don't Know. I also
Started using pycharm since it is easier to use when coding in python than Vs Code.
