# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 9, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Studied and experimented how Kivy works plans to work on a GUI project with python.

 
**Thoughts**: Still stucked on the configuration part but I grasp the basics somehow.

### Day 1: May 23, 2021
**Today's Progress**: I'm able to perform basic syntax of the Kivy lang. Did some experiments on how it works.

Also made a recall for basics of javascript I'm currently on objects and array manipulation plans to advance tommorow.


 
**Thoughts**: I'm getting a hard time mixing both school works and programming.
Also I'm too used in the python Lang that I always mix it up with js code often forget semicolon when writing code!!!
